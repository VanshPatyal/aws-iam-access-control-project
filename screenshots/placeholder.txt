Screenshots will be added after AWS console testing is complete.

This folder will contain:
- iam-users.png (list of users created)
- iam-groups.png (groups with attached policies)
- access-testing-s3.png (testing S3 permissions)
- access-testing-ec2.png (testing EC2 permissions)
- cloudtrail-logs.png (verification of actions)

To add screenshots later:
1. Take screenshots during AWS console testing
2. Upload them to this folder
3. Update README with image links
