# AWS IAM Access Control & Policy Implementation

## 📋 Project Overview
This project demonstrates implementation of **least-privilege IAM policies** for AWS environments. I created role-based access groups (S3 Support, EC2 Support, EC2 Admin) and tested permissions to ensure users have exactly the access they need.

## 🎯 Business Value
- **Security:** Prevents unauthorized access and accidental deletions
- **Compliance:** Follows AWS security best practices
- **Cost Efficiency:** Reduces risk of misconfiguration

## 🛠️ AWS Services Used
- IAM (Users, Groups, Policies)
- EC2 (for testing access)
- S3 (for testing access)
- CloudTrail (for monitoring)
